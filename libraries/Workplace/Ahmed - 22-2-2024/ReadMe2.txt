IMPORTANT: This is an experimental code and is NOT the final code.
This file is to run on top of other existing controllers on Webot.

The code aims to update dynamic coordinates of the target, opponents, and objects of interest.
The main objectives of this code are:
- Obtain and update the ball's coords through the supervisor based on two parameters.
- Obtain and update the opp. coords based on two parameters.
- Inegrating a closed-loop PID controller to be tested then replaced later with FL model.
